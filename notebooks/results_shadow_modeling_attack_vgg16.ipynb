    "We load results for MIAs trained using different features (specified below as ```activations```, ```gradients```, or ```activations,gradients```), extracted from different layers (e.g., ```fc2``` which stands for the second fully connected layer). The features can be extracted from different types of shadow models, indicated in the ```attacker_accessess``` list below. We hope the naming to be self-explanatory. We refer you to ```shadow_modelling_attack.py``` for more details on the different types of shadow models. "
